Shipping document verification
From email inbox to discrepancy report
Context
A shipping operations team receives different kinds of messages in the same inbox: requests to check
documents, prepare new shipping instructions, answer invoice questions, and share operational
updates. Spam arrives alongside them.
For a document-checking request, the team compares a Shipping Instruction (SI), which contains the
intended shipment details, with a draft Bill of Lading (BL). The SI is the reference for this check. The
goal is to catch incorrect details before the draft is finalized.
The problems
Finding the right emails takes time. Staff must read each message and decide what action it
needs. A document request that is overlooked never reaches the checking step.
Manual comparison is repetitive and easy to get wrong. Names, ports, quantities, and weight
must be checked across two documents. A missed discrepancy can lead to corrections, delays, and
additional work.
The same information can look different. One document may say “Port of Loading” while the
other says “Load Port.” The system needs to recognize that these refer to the same field.
What the system should be able to do
Starting from the inbox, the system should produce a clear result for each email. How you design the
workflow is up to you, but it should generally be able to:
Capability What it means

Classify Tell the different kinds of messages apart, including document-
comparison requests, new SI requests, invoice queries, general

messages, and spam.

Extract data For comparison requests, read the SI and BL attachments and identify

the corresponding shipment fields.

Compare Check the values and surface any mismatched fields, showing the SI and

BL values side by side.

Ask for help When it cannot complete the task on its own, escalate to a person
(human in the loop) with the relevant context, rather than guessing or
failing silently.

The starting version uses JSON email records and plain-text attachments. Other email categories only need
to be classified; only document-comparison requests continue to the checking step. The approach used to
achieve these capabilities is left to the participant.

Expected result and extensions
What the comparison covers
Check seven fields: shipper, consignee, notify party, port of loading, port of discharge, container
count, and gross weight in kilograms.
The report should make it easy to see which email was checked, whether a mismatch was found, and
exactly what needs attention. If all seven fields match, report “No mismatch detected.”

Example
The SI lists 3 containers and 22,000 kg. The BL lists 4 containers and 22,000 kg. If the other fields
agree, flag only the container count and show SI: 3 / BL: 4.

Advanced stage
Classifying emails, extracting fields from plain text, and comparing values are the basic, common
expectations. Once that works, we encourage you to go further and attempt a more advanced solution
using the sample data we provide, which includes more realistic documents and harder decisions.
Advanced challenge What changes
PDF and Word attachments Replace plain-text attachments with PDFs and Word documents. You
need to extract information from tables and different page layouts.
Scanned documents Use image-only PDFs or scanned pages. You can use optical
character recognition (OCR), a vision-capable LLM, or both to read
and compare the content.

Messier inputs Introduce varied field labels, formatting differences, misleading email
subjects, or missing attachments. The system must distinguish a real
discrepancy from a reading or formatting issue.

Reliability and human
review

When a document is unreadable, a required value is missing, or the
result is uncertain, send the case for review with the source evidence
and reason. Let a person confirm or correct it, then update the report.
Handle processing failures visibly and allow retries.

Accuracy means identifying the right requests and the right discrepancies without creating false
alarms. The reliability challenge considers what happens when the system cannot make a dependable
decision, including when human input is needed.
The basic use case remains the same at every stage: find the document request, compare the shipment
details, and explain any mismatch. The advanced stage is where you can stand out by handling the harder,
more realistic sample data.

Working with the data
The dataset contains inbox records in JSON, together with the SI and BL attachments referenced by
those emails. The answer key is not included. You can check your result using the self-evaluation
endpoint described on the next page.
Two ways to access the data
Option How you use it
Static bundle A ZIP file containing inbox/, attachments/, sample_submission.json,
and a helper file called loader.py. Extract the ZIP and read the files
directly. No service needs to be started.

Local server (Docker) Run docker compose up --build to access the same dataset over HTTP
at <http://localhost:8080>. No database or additional setup is required.

The loader
The included loader.py provides the same interface for both options. Point it to either the extracted
data folder or the local server:

Example
from loader import Inbox
inbox = Inbox("data") — or Inbox("<http://localhost:8080>")
for email in inbox: reads each email record, while inbox.read_text(path) returns the
text from an SI or BL attachment.

Start with one email and its two attachments so you can see how the records are connected. The participant
guide included with the data explains the access options and the fields in detail.

Evaluating your own output
How you design your system and what it produces internally is entirely up to you. To help you gauge
how well it is doing, the local server includes an optional self-evaluation endpoint. Submit your result
and the server compares it with a private reference set, then returns a scoreboard. The reference
answers are not included in the response.
Formatting your output for the self-evaluation
The self-evaluation only needs your output in one agreed shape so it can be read automatically: one
JSON object keyed by email_id, following the format in sample_submission.json. Include every email
in the dataset, and for a document-comparison request report its category, whether a mismatch was
found, and the fields that differ. This shape is only required if you want to use the self-evaluation — it is
not a constraint on how your system works internally.

How to run it
With the local server running, send your formatted output to POST /submit or call
inbox.submit(...) through the loader. The response contains the evaluation result without
exposing the reference answers.

How to use the result
The scoreboard is meant to help you find problems while you build. It is not the final assessment and
does not cover every part of a good solution.
Check where your system classified an email incorrectly or missed a document mismatch.
Review cases where the input was incomplete or uncertain. A score cannot fully assess whether the
system asked for human review at the right time or provided enough context.
If your result differs from the reference, check the source documents before changing it. If your
decision is reasonable, record the reason.
You can submit your output as often as needed while developing. Use the result to improve accuracy, and
separately test how your system behaves when information is missing, unclear, or unreadable.
